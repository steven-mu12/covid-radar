The source code for the Covid Radar Android App and Arduino code.

Covid Radar is a hardware and software hybrid hackathon project that is used to detect whenever someone gets closer than 6 feet to the user.

Covid Radar has 2 components:
1) The Android App
2) The Ultrasonic Sensor Hat

The Ultrasonic Sensor Hat connects to the application via bluetooth. Whenever someone gets closer than 6 feet to the user, 
the hat sends a signal to the phone. The phone logs when the person came close, and how close the person got. 
The phone also plays an alarm when someone gets closer than 6 feet to scare the person away.
